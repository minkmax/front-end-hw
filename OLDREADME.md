# Front-end Choose Your Own Adventure Take-Home

### Generalist

I built the MVP for this project! 

Instructions on how to set it up:


## Interview Details

We have already set up an API client for a Node Express server that stores comments in SQLite.

You have the option of doing the assignment with or without a front-end JS framework.

If you decide to use a framework, we recommend the following boilerplates:
* [facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [vuejs/vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
* [angular/angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
* [ember-cli/ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli)

Be prepared to have a discussion about your implementation. Here are some example discussion questions:
* How can you optimize fetching new comments in real-time?
* Are there any restrictions we should place on the comment input?

We recommend spending up to four hours on this assignment. If you don't get every piece you hoped completed done in the timeframe, that's alright! We'll be having an hour long discussion on your thought processes and where you might spend more time, and that discussion is a key part of our evaluation!
